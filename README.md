# GPRS communication library using STM32 and SIM808 module.
This project provides a library for communicating with the SIM808 module via UART on STM32 microcontrollers. It supports basic GPRS functionality including HTTP GET and POST requests, making it suitable for IoT applications that require internet connectivity.
# Features
UART communication with SIM808 module
HTTP GET and POST requests
GPRS connection management
API developpement
Testing and error handling
STM32 HAL compatible 
# Hardware Requirements
STM32F4xx microcontroller
SIM808 GSM/GPRS module
UART connection between STM32 and SIM808 (typically 9600 baud)
Power supply for both devices
# Software Requirements
STM32CubeIDE or compatible toolchain
STM32 HAL libraries
Standard C libraries
Keil uvision5 
ST Link Debugger
# Installation
1- Clone this repository into your STM32 project directory
